Fourth of the Frontend Mentor Design Challenges. 
This one was much more difficult as I found the change in layout between mobile and desktop different and less manageable with the usual flexbox. 
I also struggled to identify the correct colours from the design palette due to their similarity.
But a challenge is good!
